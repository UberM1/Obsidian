    desc: "_Melee Weapon Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. _Hit:_ 7 (2d4 + 3) necrotic damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target's available Hit Dice are reduced by 1.\nIf this effect reduces the target's Hit Dice to 0, the target falls unconscious. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, regaining consciousness on a success. Hit Dice lost this way return at the end of a short rest, in time to spend them to regain hit points. If an oblivion leaper kills a living creature with this attack when the creature is at 0 Hit Dice, the target's soul is lost to the realm of shadow. This lost soul can be raised from the dead only with mighty magic, such as wish or divine intervention."
